Camera tools for capturing cool shots in JC3MP

## Installation

Just drop it in your packages directory, and you're done!

## Usage
- Press F6 to open up the menu.
- While in Freecam mode, use WASD to move, space to go up, shift to go down, and arrow keys to look around.
- You must have at least 2 points on your path in order to use pathing camera.

## Notes
- The camera rotation does not change for players in cars when using the tracking camera.
- The camera position is a little weird sometimes when players grapple or wingsuit when using the tracking camera.
- Pathing camera isn't fully smoothed yet.
- Controllers are now supported. Use Left Stick to move left/right/forward/backward, use Right Stick to move up/down, use the X button to toggle between movement mode and rotation mode, and use the B button to toggle freecam mode.
